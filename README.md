# SAS-Job-Satisfaction
Using SAS, I analyzed survey results from close to 500 participants regarding job satisfaction on a scale of 0-15. The data was cleaned, missing values were addressed, and proper formatting was applied. Following the data preparation, I conducted a regression analysis to determine which of the 8 factors were significant in predicting employee success and happiness.

The statistically significant factors identified in the model were:

- Relationships with colleagues
- Relationships with managers
- Opportunity for advancement
- Whether the participant was a visible minority
To ensure the robustness of these findings, the study was replicated using the same participants. The results were cross-validated with the replicated data, and all four factors were verified as significant. This verification employed a Bonferroni correction with a significance level of 0.05.
The model was successfully able to capture 94% of job satisfaction scores.
